# Holt

**The Enterprise-Grade AI Orchestrator for Secure, Auditable, and Compliant Workflows**

Holt enables organizations to safely automate complex software engineering tasks using AI agentsâ€”while maintaining complete control, security, and regulatory compliance.

## Enterprise-Ready by Design

Holt is not just a development tool; it is built for production workflows where security, compliance, and monitoring are paramount. It provides a suite of enterprise-grade features out-of-the-box, derived directly from its simple, first-principles architecture.

#### 1. Complete & Immutable Auditability

Holt provides a complete, unchangeable audit trail for the entire lifecycle of a workflow. This is not an add-on; it is a core property of the system.

*   **Immutable Ledger:** Every action, decision, and artefact is recorded as an immutable entry on the central blackboard.
*   **Queryable History:** The `holt hoard` command provides an out-of-the-box tool to inspect and query this audit trail, allowing developers and compliance officers to trace any workflow from start to finish.
*   **Git-Native Versioning:** For code-related tasks, every change is tied to a Git commit hash, integrating the audit trail with an industry-standard version control system.

#### 2. Powerful, Built-in Observability

Holt provides integrated tools for monitoring and debugging your AI agents and workflows in real time.

*   **Automated Health Checks:** Every agent runs with a mandatory, built-in health check, allowing the orchestrator to immediately detect and report on agents that have crashed or become unresponsive.
*   **Real-time Monitoring:** The `holt watch` command provides a live stream of all system events. With powerful filtering by **time, agent, and artefact type**, you can zero in on the exact information you need.
*   **Machine-Readable Output:** The `watch` and `hoard` commands can output events as line-delimited JSON (`jsonl`), allowing you to seamlessly pipe Holt's observability data into external logging and monitoring systems like Splunk, Datadog, or the ELK stack.
*   **Targeted Debugging:** The `holt logs <agent-name>` command lets you instantly access the logs for any specific agent, streamlining the debugging process.

#### 3. Flexible, Container-Native Deployment

Holt's architecture is designed for a seamless transition from local development to production deployment on any standard container platform.

*   **Local Development:** The `holt up` command provides a simple, `docker-compose`-like experience for running a complete Holt instance on your local machine.
*   **Production-Ready Architecture:** Because every agent and Holt component is a container, a `holt.yml` configuration serves as a blueprint for production. This stack can be deployed to any major orchestrator, including **Kubernetes, Amazon ECS, or Google Cloud Run**.
*   **Future: First-Class Kubernetes Native:** The Phase 6 roadmap will make Holt a first-class citizen in Kubernetes. This includes a **Holt Operator** for managing the entire lifecycle, native integration with Kubernetes health and logging, and built-in **Prometheus metrics endpoints** for seamless integration with your existing monitoring infrastructure.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Docker** (20.10+) - For running agent containers
- **Git** (2.x+) - For workspace management
- **Go** (1.21+) - For building Holt binaries

### Installation & First Workflow

```bash
# 1. Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/dyluth/holt.git
cd holt

# 2. Build binaries
make build

# 3. Create test project
mkdir my-project && cd my-project
git init
git commit --allow-empty -m "Initial commit"

# 4. Initialize Holt
holt init

# 5. Build example git agent
docker build -t example-git-agent:latest -f agents/example-git-agent/Dockerfile ..

# 6. Configure agent in holt.yml
cat > holt.yml <<EOF
version: "1.0"
agents:
  git-agent:
    role: "Git Agent"
    image: "example-git-agent:latest"
    command: ["/app/run.sh"]
    workspace:
      mode: rw
services:
  redis:
    image: redis:7-alpine
EOF

# 7. Start Holt instance
holt up

# 8. Create workflow
holt forage --goal "hello.txt"

# 9. Watch agent execute
holt watch

# 10. View results
holt hoard
git log --oneline
ls -la hello.txt  # File created by agent!
```

**What just happened?**

1. Holt started an orchestrator and your git agent in Docker containers
2. The orchestrator created a claim for your goal ("hello.txt")
3. The git agent bid on and won the claim
4. The agent created `hello.txt` in your workspace and committed it
5. A `CodeCommit` artefact was created on the blackboard with the commit hash
6. Complete audit trail preserved in Redis and Git history

## How It Works: A Conceptual Overview

This diagram illustrates the high-level conceptual workflow of the Holt system, demonstrating how a user goal initiates a collaborative, auditable process between the orchestrator and a clan of specialized AI agents interacting via the central Redis Blackboard.

## Core Concepts

### The Blackboard

A Redis-based shared state system where all components interact. Think of it as a lightweight ledger storing:

- **Artefacts**: Immutable work products (code commits, designs, analyses)
- **Claims**: The orchestrator's decisions about work assignment
- **Bids**: Agents' expressions of interest in claims

Every interaction is timestamped and recorded, creating an immutable audit trail perfect for regulated environments.

### Artefacts

Immutable data objects representing work products. Each artefact has:

- **type**: User-defined (e.g., "CodeCommit", "DesignSpec", "TestReport")
- **payload**: Main content (commit hash, JSON data, text)
- **source_artefacts**: Dependency chain for provenance tracking
- **structural_type**: Role in orchestration (Standard, Review, Question, Answer, Failure, Terminal)

Artefacts never change. Instead, new versions form logical threads tracked via `logical_id`.

### Claims & Phased Execution

When an artefact is created, the orchestrator creates a **claim** and agents bid on it. Claims progress through phases:

1. **Review Phase**: Parallel review by multiple agents (Phase 3)
2. **Parallel Phase**: Concurrent work by multiple agents (Phase 3)
3. **Exclusive Phase**: Single agent gets exclusive access âœ… (Phase 2)

Agents submit bids ("review", "claim", "exclusive", "ignore") based on their capabilities and the work required.

### The Agent Pup

A lightweight Go binary that runs as the entrypoint in every agent container. It:

- Watches for claims via Pub/Sub
- Submits bids on behalf of the agent
- Assembles historical context via graph traversal
- Executes the agent's tool script with JSON contract
- Creates artefacts from tool output
- Operates concurrently to remain responsive

**Key insight:** The pup handles orchestration complexity. You just write the tool logic.

### Agents

Docker containers packaging:

1. **Agent pup binary** (handles Holt integration)
2. **Tool script** (your custom logic - shell, Python, anything)
3. **Dependencies** (LLM APIs, compilers, CLIs, etc.)

Agents communicate with the pup via stdin/stdout JSON:

**Input:**
```json
{
  "claim_type": "exclusive",
  "target_artefact": { "type": "GoalDefined", "payload": "build auth API", ... },
  "context_chain": [ /* historical artefacts */ ]
}
```

**Output:**
```json
{
  "artefact_type": "CodeCommit",
  "artefact_payload": "abc123def456...",
  "summary": "Implemented authentication endpoints"
}
```

### Git-Centric Workflow

Holt assumes and requires a clean Git repository. Code artefacts are git commit hashes, and agents are responsible for:

- Creating or modifying files
- Committing changes with descriptive messages
- Returning commit hashes as `CodeCommit` artefacts

The pup validates commit hashes exist before creating artefacts, ensuring integrity.

### Human-in-the-Loop

Holt is designed for human oversight:

- **Question artefacts**: Agents can ask humans for guidance (Phase 4)
- **Review phase**: Humans or review agents can provide feedback before execution (Phase 3)
- **Complete audit trail**: Every decision is traceable for compliance
- **Manual intervention**: Humans can inspect state and intervene at any point
```

## Building Custom Agents

### Minimal Echo Agent

**agents/my-agent/run.sh:**
```bash
#!/bin/sh
input=$(cat)

# Extract goal from payload
goal=$(echo "$input" | grep -o '"payload":"[^"]*"' | head -1 | cut -d'"' -f4)

echo "Processing: $goal" >&2

# Output result
cat <<EOF
{
  "artefact_type": "Processed",
  "artefact_payload": "Result for $goal",
  "summary": "Processing complete"
}
EOF
```

**agents/my-agent/Dockerfile:**
```dockerfile
FROM golang:1.24-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /build
COPY go.mod go.sum ./
RUN go mod download
COPY cmd/pup ./cmd/pup
COPY internal/pup ./internal/pup
COPY pkg/blackboard ./pkg/blackboard
RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o pup ./cmd/pup

FROM alpine:latest
RUN apk --no-cache add ca-certificates
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /build/pup /app/pup
COPY agents/my-agent/run.sh /app/run.sh
RUN chmod +x /app/run.sh
RUN adduser -D -u 1000 agent
USER agent
ENTRYPOINT ["/app/pup"]
```

**holt.yml:**
```yaml
version: "1.0"
agents:
  my-agent:
    role: "My Agent"
    image: "my-agent:latest"
    command: ["/app/run.sh"]
    workspace:
      mode: ro
services:
  redis:
    image: redis:7-alpine
```

**Build & Run:**
```bash
docker build -t my-agent:latest -f agents/my-agent/Dockerfile .
holt up
holt forage --goal "test input"
holt logs my-agent
```

## Example Agents

### Echo Agent
**Location:** `agents/example-agent/`

Simple agent demonstrating basic stdin/stdout contract. Reads goal, logs it, outputs success artefact.

**Use case:** Learning, testing, proof-of-concept

### Git Agent
**Location:** `agents/example-git-agent/`

Creates files in workspace and commits them, returning `CodeCommit` artefacts.

**Use case:** Code generation, file creation, project scaffolding

**Example workflow:**
```bash
# Build agent
docker build -t example-git-agent:latest -f agents/example-git-agent/Dockerfile .

# Start Holt
holt up

# Create file via agent
holt forage --goal "implementation.go"

# Verify result
git log --oneline  # Shows commit by agent
ls implementation.go  # File exists
holt hoard  # Shows CodeCommit artefact
```

## Key Design Principles

### Pragmatism over Novelty (YAGNI)

We use battle-hardened tools (Docker, Redis, Git) rather than building custom solutions. Holt is an orchestrator, not a database or container runtime.

### Zero-Configuration, Progressively Enhanced

`holt init && holt up` creates a working system. Smart defaults cover 90% of use cases. Advanced features available when needed.

### Auditability as a Core Feature

Artefacts are immutable. Every decision is recorded on the blackboard with timestamps. Complete audit trail for compliance and debugging.

### Small, Single-Purpose Components

Each component (orchestrator, CLI, agent pup) has one job and does it excellently. Complexity is managed through composition.

### Container-Native by Design

Agents can use any tool that can be containerized - not just Python functions. This enables orchestration of compilers, CLIs, infrastructure tools, and more.

---
