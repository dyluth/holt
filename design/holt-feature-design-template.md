# **Feature design: \[Feature Name\]**

**Purpose**: Systematic template for designing features with comprehensive analysis  
**Scope**: Template - use when designing any new feature  
**Estimated tokens**: ~3,500 tokens  
**Read when**: Starting feature design, need complete analysis framework

Associated phase: \[Heartbeat | Single Agent | Coordination | Human-in-the-Loop\]  
Status: \[Draft | In Review | Approved\]  
***Template purpose:*** *This* document is a blueprint for a single, implementable milestone. Its purpose is to provide an unambiguous specification for a developer (human *or AI) to build a feature that is consistent with Holt's architecture and guiding principles.*

## **1\. The 'why': goal and success criteria**

### **1.1. Goal statement**

\<\!-- State the primary, user-visible goal of this milestone in a single, clear sentence. \--\>

### **1.2. User story**

\<\!-- Provide a brief, one-paragraph narrative from the user's perspective. e.g., "As an agent developer, I want to see the real-time logs from my running agent so that I can debug its behaviour without manually finding the container ID." \--\>

### **1.3. Success criteria**

\<\!-- List 2-3 specific, observable outcomes that will prove this milestone is complete. Frame these as executable end-to-end tests.

* e.g., "A user can run holt logs my-agent and the live logs from the agent container are streamed to the terminal."

**Validation questions:**
* Can each success criterion be automated as a test?
* Does each criterion represent user-visible value?
* Are the criteria specific enough to avoid ambiguity?
  \--\>

### **1.4. Non-goals**

\<\!-- Explicitly state what is out of scope for this milestone to prevent scope creep.

* e.g., "This milestone will not include log filtering or exporting logs to a file."  
  \--\>

## **2\. The 'what': component impact analysis**

*This section is a mandatory checklist. For each component, detail the required changes. If a component is not affected, state "No changes."*

**Critical validation questions for this entire section:**
* Have I explicitly considered EVERY component (Blackboard, Orchestrator, Pup, CLI)?
* For components marked "No changes" - am I absolutely certain this feature doesn't affect them?
* Do my changes maintain the contracts and interfaces defined in the design documents?
* Will this feature work correctly with both single-instance and scaled agents (controller-worker pattern)?

### **2.1. Blackboard changes**

* New/modified data structures:  
  \<\!-- Detail any changes to the Artefact, Claim, or Bids schemas. Define any new Redis keys or data types needed. \--\>  
* New Pub/Sub channels:  
  \<\!-- List any new channels required for eventing. \--\>

### **2.2. Orchestrator changes**

* New/modified logic:  
  \<\!-- Describe changes to the orchestrator's core loop. How does it handle new artefact types? Does this impact the "Full Consensus Model" or the phased lifecycle? \--\>  
* New/modified configurations (holt.yml):  
  \<\!-- Define any new fields that must be added to the holt.yml file to support this feature. \--\>

### **2.3. Agent pup changes**

* New/modified logic:  
  \<\!-- Describe changes to the pup's concurrent loops. Does it need to handle new claim types? \--\>  
* Changes to the tool execution contract (stdin/stdout):  
  \<\!-- Specify any modifications to the JSON passed to or expected from the agent's command script. \--\>

### **2.4. CLI changes**

* New/modified commands:  
  \<\!-- Define any new CLI commands, including their flags, arguments, and expected behaviour. \--\>  
* Changes to user output:  
  \<\!-- Describe any changes to the information displayed to the user. \--\>

## **3\. The 'how': implementation & testing plan**

### **3.1. Key design decisions & risks**

\<\!-- List the 1-2 most critical technical decisions made (e.g., "We will use Redis Pub/Sub for this feature because...") and any potential risks.

**Validation questions:**
* Have I considered alternative approaches and justified why this approach is best?
* Are there any assumptions that could prove incorrect?
* What are the biggest risks to successful implementation?
* How does this approach align with Holt's architectural principles?
  \--\>

### **3.2. Implementation steps**

\<\!-- Provide a high-level, phased checklist of implementation steps, broken down by component.

* \[Orchestrator\] Implement new claim status transition...  
* \[Pup\] Add logic to handle new stdin field...  
* \[CLI\] Create the new holt xyz command...  
  \--\>

### **3.3. Performance & resource considerations**

* Resource usage:  
  \<\!-- Estimate CPU, memory, and storage impact. Consider impact on Redis, container resources, and network traffic. \--\>  
* Scalability limits:  
  \<\!-- What are the expected limits? How many concurrent operations? How does it scale with agent count? \--\>  
* Performance requirements:  
  \<\!-- Define acceptable latency, throughput, or response time requirements. \--\>

### **3.4. Testing strategy**

* Unit tests:  
  \<\!-- List the key functions or logic to be unit-tested. Mention any necessary mocks (e.g., a mock blackboard client). \--\>  
* Integration tests:  
  \<\!-- Describe how the components will be tested together (e.g., "Test that when the CLI creates X, the orchestrator correctly creates Y."). \--\>  
* Performance tests:  
  \<\!-- Define tests to verify performance requirements are met under expected load. \--\>  
* E2E tests (holt tests):  
  \<\!-- Define at least one end-to-end user story test. Specify the initial state (the holt forage command) and the final state to be asserted (e.g., specific artefacts on the blackboard, files in the workspace). \--\>

## **4\. Principle compliance check**

### **4.1. YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It)**

\<\!-- List any new third-party dependencies being introduced. Justify why this functionality cannot be achieved with our existing toolset. \--\>

### **4.2. Auditability**

\<\!-- Describe the new artefacts that will be created by this feature. Confirm that all significant state changes are captured as immutable artefacts on the blackboard. \--\>

### **4.3. Small, single-purpose components**

\<\!-- Confirm that the proposed changes are localised to the components identified in section 2 and do not introduce tight coupling or blur responsibilities. \--\>

### **4.4. Security considerations**

\<\!-- Identify security implications of this feature:
* Does it introduce new attack surfaces or data exposure risks?
* Are credentials, secrets, or sensitive data properly protected?
* Does it impact container isolation or privilege boundaries?
* Are new network communications properly secured?
  \--\>

### **4.5. Backward compatibility**

\<\!-- Analyze compatibility impact:
* Does this change existing APIs or data structures?
* Are existing workflows preserved or do they require migration?
* Is the feature additive (preferred) or does it modify existing behavior?
* What is the deprecation path for any breaking changes?
  \--\>

### **4.6. Dependency impact**

\<\!-- Assess impact on system dependencies:
* Does this feature change Redis usage patterns or requirements?
* Are there new Docker or container runtime requirements?
* Does it affect minimum Go version or introduce new build dependencies?
* Are there implications for the development environment or CI/CD pipeline?
  \--\>

  \--\>

### **6.2. Concurrency considerations**
