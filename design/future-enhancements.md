## Git Workspace Management

### Git Worktrees for Agent Isolation

**Context**: Currently, agents share a single workspace and use `git checkout <commit>` to work on specific commits. This can leave the workspace in detached HEAD state and requires careful coordination.

**Idea**: Use git worktrees to give each agent an isolated workspace:

```bash
# Agent creates temporary worktree
worktree_path="/workspace/.holt-worktrees/$AGENT_NAME-$CLAIM_ID"
git worktree add "$worktree_path" "$commit_hash"
cd "$worktree_path"

# Work on files in isolation
# ... agent work ...

# Cleanup
cd /workspace
git worktree remove "$worktree_path"
```

**Benefits**:
- **True isolation**: Multiple agents can work on different commits simultaneously without conflicts
- **Cleaner workspace state**: Main workspace stays on its original branch
- **Safer concurrent execution**: No risk of one agent's checkout interfering with another
- **Better debugging**: Each worktree is independent, easier to inspect

**Challenges**:
- **Complexity**: Agents need to manage worktree lifecycle (create, work, cleanup)
- **Disk space**: Each worktree is a full checkout (though sharing git objects)
- **Path management**: Agents must be aware they're working in a subdirectory
- **Container mounts**: Need to ensure worktree paths are within mounted volume
- **Error handling**: Cleanup must be robust (what if agent crashes mid-work?)

**Current Solution**:
Terminal agents (e.g., ModulePackager) update the main branch pointer and checkout main after completion. This is simple and solves the detached HEAD UX issue for demos.

**When to Revisit**:
- When we need higher concurrency (e.g., dozens of parallel agents)
- When implementing advanced branching strategies (feature branches, PRs)
- When git state conflicts become a production issue
- Phase 5+ when scaling becomes a priority

**Design Considerations**:
- Should worktree management be in the pup, or left to agent scripts?
- How to handle cleanup on agent crash or timeout?
- Should we use a shared worktree pool, or create/destroy per-claim?
- What's the performance impact of worktree creation vs checkout?

## Advanced Security & Access Control

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

**Context**: As Holt is adopted in larger organizations, there is a need to control who can perform specific actions. Currently, any user with access to the CLI can run any command.
**Idea**: Implement a comprehensive RBAC system for the Holt CLI and potentially the orchestrator. This would involve defining roles (e.g., `admin`, `developer`, `auditor`) and associating them with specific permissions.
**Benefits**:
- **Security**: Prevents unauthorized users from performing destructive actions (e.g., `holt down --force` on a production instance).
- **Compliance**: Allows organizations to enforce separation of duties. An `auditor` role could have read-only access to the blackboard, while a `developer` role could run `forage` but not modify production instances.
**Challenges**:
- Requires an identity and authentication system.
- Permission model needs to be designed carefully to be flexible but not overly complex.
- Enforcement would need to happen at both the CLI and orchestrator levels.
**When to Revisit**: When Holt is being deployed in multi-team environments or when production security becomes a primary concern.

### Secrets Management Integration

**Context**: Agents often require secrets like API keys, database credentials, or private SSH keys. The current method of using environment variables in `holt.yml` is not secure for production environments as it stores secrets in plaintext.
**Idea**: Integrate Holt with enterprise-standard secrets management solutions like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or Kubernetes Secrets. The agent pup would be responsible for securely fetching secrets at runtime.
**Benefits**:
- **Enhanced Security**: Secrets are not stored in plaintext in the Git repository.
- **Centralized Management**: Enterprises can manage secrets using their existing, audited tools.
- **Dynamic Secrets**: Supports solutions that provide short-lived, dynamically generated credentials.
**Challenges**:
- Requires building pluggable integrations for different secret backends.
- The agent pup needs a secure identity to authenticate with the secrets manager.
**When to Revisit**: Before any serious production deployment that involves agents handling sensitive credentials.

## Sophisticated Workflow & Resource Management

### Workflow Priority Queues

**Context**: Currently, the orchestrator processes goals in the order they are received. In a busy system, a critical production hotfix could be queued behind routine, low-priority tasks.
**Idea**: Introduce a `priority` field for goals submitted via `holt forage`. The orchestrator would maintain priority queues and service higher-priority claims first.
**Benefits**:
- **Improved Responsiveness**: Ensures that urgent tasks are addressed immediately.
- **Better Resource Allocation**: Allows operators to manage system load more effectively by prioritizing critical workflows.
**Challenges**:
- Requires significant changes to the orchestrator's claim processing logic.
- Needs a strategy to prevent starvation of low-priority tasks.
**When to Revisit**: When Holt is used to manage a high volume of concurrent workflows with varying business importance.

### Parameterized Workflows

**Context**: Workflows are currently triggered with a static text goal. To reuse a workflow for a slightly different purpose, a new goal must be manually crafted.
**Idea**: Allow `holt forage` to accept structured parameters, e.g., `holt forage --goal "deploy-service" --param service=api --param version=1.2.3`. The agent tools would then receive these parameters in their input context.
**Benefits**:
- **Reusability**: Workflows become reusable templates that can be invoked with different inputs.
- **Automation**: Enables easier integration with external systems (like a CI/CD pipeline) that can trigger Holt workflows with specific parameters.
**Challenges**:
- The `GoalDefined` artefact schema would need to be updated to support parameters.
- The agent tool contract would need to be extended to include this new context.
**When to Revisit**: When users start building libraries of common, reusable workflows.

## Deeper Auditability & Compliance

### Digital Artefact Signing

**Context**: While the blackboard provides an audit trail, high-stakes industries (finance, pharma) may require cryptographic proof of an artefact's origin and integrity.
**Idea**: Require agents to digitally sign the artefacts they produce using a key (e.g., GPG, JWT). The orchestrator would verify this signature before accepting the artefact onto the blackboard.
**Benefits**:
- **Non-repudiation**: Provides cryptographic proof that a specific agent created a specific artefact.
- **Enhanced Integrity**: Guarantees that artefacts have not been tampered with after creation.
**Challenges**:
- Requires a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) to manage agent keys.
- Adds computational overhead for signing and verification.
**When to Revisit**: When Holt is being considered for use cases with stringent regulatory or legal requirements for data integrity.

### Automated Compliance Reporting

**Context**: While `holt hoard` allows for raw data export, compliance officers often need summarized, human-readable reports.
**Idea**: Create a new command, `holt audit report`, that generates a summary report of all activity over a given period. The report would include metrics like workflows started, success/failure rates, number of human interventions (Q&A), and a list of all terminal artefacts.
**Benefits**:
- **Streamlines Compliance**: Radically simplifies the process of generating audit reports.
- **Provides Business Insights**: Offers a high-level view of the system's performance and efficiency.
**Challenges**:
- The report format needs to be designed carefully to be useful to a non-technical audience.
- Aggregating data across many workflows could be computationally intensive.
**When to Revisit**: When Holt is adopted by teams with dedicated compliance or audit functions.

## High Availability & Scalability

### High-Availability (HA) Orchestrator

**Context**: The current orchestrator is a single point of failure. If it crashes, the entire Holt instance stops processing new work.
**Idea**: Implement a high-availability model for the orchestrator, such as an active-passive or active-active configuration using a leader election protocol (e.g., via Redis locks or a library like etcd).
**Benefits**:
- **Resilience**: The system can automatically recover from the failure of a single orchestrator node.
- **Zero Downtime**: Enables rolling upgrades of the orchestrator without interrupting workflow processing.
**Challenges**:
- Leader election and state reconciliation are complex distributed systems problems.
- Requires careful management of the orchestrator's in-memory state.
**When to Revisit**: When Holt is used to run business-critical, long-running production workflows that cannot tolerate downtime.

### Pluggable Blackboard Backend

**Context**: Holt is currently tied to Redis as its blackboard. While Redis is highly performant, some enterprises may have different requirements or existing infrastructure (e.g., a preference for etcd, or a need for a managed cloud database).
**Idea**: Refactor the `pkg/blackboard` client to be an interface. Redis would be the default implementation, but other backends could be developed and plugged in.
**Benefits**:
- **Flexibility**: Allows Holt to be adapted to different enterprise environments and requirements.
- **Scalability**: Enables the use of globally distributed databases for massive-scale, multi-region deployments.
**Challenges**:
- Requires a carefully designed, generic interface that doesn't leak Redis-specific concepts.
- Each new backend is a significant development effort.
**When to Revisit**: When enterprise customers with specific data store requirements emerge, or when a single Redis instance becomes a scalability bottleneck.
