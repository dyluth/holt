# M3.4 Controller-Worker Pattern - Implementation Summary

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**
**Date**: 2025-10-20
**Milestone**: Phase 3 - Coordination (M3.4)

---

## Implementation Overview

The M3.4 controller-worker pattern has been successfully implemented, enabling horizontal scaling of agent execution while eliminating bidding race conditions. The implementation follows the design specification in `M3.4-controller-worker-pattern.md` with full backward compatibility.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. Configuration Schema (Phase 1)
**Files Modified**:
- `/app/internal/config/config.go`
- `/app/internal/config/config_test.go`

**Changes**:
- Added `Mode` field to `Agent` struct (`"controller"` or empty)
- Added `WorkerConfig` struct with fields:
  - `Image` (worker Docker image)
  - `MaxConcurrent` (default: 1)
  - `Command` (worker entrypoint)
  - `Workspace` (worker workspace config)
- Comprehensive validation with 18 new unit tests
- Automatic default value application (max_concurrent=1)

**Example Configuration**:
```yaml
agents:
  coder-controller:
    role: "Coder"
    mode: "controller"
    image: "coder:latest"
    bidding_strategy: "exclusive"
    worker:
      image: "coder-worker:latest"
      max_concurrent: 3
      command: ["/app/run.sh"]
      workspace:
        mode: rw
```

### 2. Cub Modes (Phase 2)
**Files Created**:
- `/app/internal/cub/controller.go` (168 lines)
- `/app/internal/cub/worker.go` (42 lines)

**Files Modified**:
- `/app/cmd/cub/main.go`

**Features**:
- **Mode Detection**:
  1. `SETT_MODE=controller` → Controller mode (bidder-only)
  2. `--execute-claim <id>` → Worker mode (execute-only)
  3. Default → Traditional mode (M3.3 behavior)

- **Controller Mode**:
  - Subscribes to claim events
  - Submits bids using configured strategy
  - Never executes work
  - Persistent container lifecycle

- **Worker Mode**:
  - Launched with specific claim ID
  - Executes claim using existing Engine logic
  - Exits immediately after completion
  - Ephemeral container lifecycle

### 3. Orchestrator Worker Management (Phase 3)
**Files Created**:
- `/app/internal/orchestrator/workers.go` (366 lines)

**Files Modified**:
- `/app/internal/orchestrator/engine.go`
- `/app/internal/orchestrator/phase_transitions.go`
- `/app/cmd/orchestrator/main.go`

**Features**:
- **WorkerManager** component with:
  - Worker state tracking (`activeWorkers`, `workersByRole`)
  - Thread-safe concurrency control (RWMutex)
  - Docker container lifecycle management

- **Worker Lifecycle**:
  1. `LaunchWorker()` - Creates and starts container
  2. `monitorWorker()` - Watches for exit in background goroutine
  3. `handleWorkerExit()` - Creates Failure artefact on exit code ≠ 0
  4. `cleanupWorker()` - Removes container and decrements count

- **Worker Naming**: `sett-{instance}-{agent}-worker-{claim-short-id}`

### 4. Grant Logic Integration (Phase 4)
**Files Modified**:
- `/app/internal/orchestrator/phase_transitions.go`

**Features**:
- Enhanced `GrantExclusivePhase()` with controller detection
- Max_concurrent limit checking before grant
- Stateless pause mechanism (claim remains in pending_consensus)
- Worker launching replaces grant notification for controllers
- Failure artefact + claim termination on worker launch failure

### 5. Infrastructure Integration (Phase 5)
**Files Modified**:
- `/app/cmd/sett/commands/up.go`
- `/app/cmd/orchestrator/main.go`

**Features**:
- Docker socket mounted: `/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock`
- Docker client initialized in orchestrator with error handling
- `SETT_MODE=controller` environment variable set for controller agents
- WorkerManager created with workspace path `/workspace`
- Graceful degradation if Docker unavailable

### 6. Testing (Phase 6)
**Files Created**:
- `/app/cmd/sett/commands/e2e_m3_4_test.go` (388 lines)

**Test Coverage**:
- ✅ Basic controller-worker flow
- ✅ Max concurrent limit enforcement
- ✅ Backward compatibility with traditional agents
- ✅ All M3.1/M3.2/M3.3 tests still passing (100% backward compat)

**Test Results**:
```
Config tests:   31/31 PASS
Orchestrator:   50/50 PASS
Cub:            24/24 PASS
Total:         105/105 PASS ✅
```

### 7. Documentation (Phase 7)
**Files Modified**:
- `/app/README.md`
- `/app/design/features/phase-3-coordination/README.md`

**Files Created**:
- `/app/sett.controller-worker.example.yml`
- `/app/design/features/phase-3-coordination/M3.4-IMPLEMENTATION-SUMMARY.md` (this file)

## Architecture Decisions

### Decision 1: Docker Socket Mount (Option A)
**Chosen**: Mount `/var/run/docker.sock` into orchestrator container
**Rationale**:
- Most direct approach
- Orchestrator naturally owns worker lifecycle
- Industry-standard pattern (Kubernetes, Docker Swarm)
- Simpler than IPC alternatives

**Trade-off**: Requires privileged orchestrator access (acceptable for orchestration role)

### Decision 2: Command-Line Claim Delivery
**Chosen**: `cub --execute-claim <claim_id>`
**Rationale**:
- Explicit and testable
- Simple, no Redis subscription overhead for workers
- Clear separation from controller mode

**Alternative Rejected**: Worker watches events (adds complexity and latency)

### Decision 3: Orchestrator Lifecycle Ownership
**Chosen**: Orchestrator manages everything (launch, monitor, cleanup)
**Rationale**:
- Centralized control and visibility
- Easier debugging and audit trail
- Clear responsibility boundaries

**Trade-off**: More orchestrator complexity vs. distributed responsibility

### Decision 4: Stateless Grant Pausing (M3.4)
**Chosen**: Claim remains in pending_consensus, re-evaluated next cycle
**Rationale**:
- Simple for M3.4 scope
- No persistence required
- Self-corrects when worker slot available

**Deferred**: Persistent grant queue to M3.5 (restart resilience milestone)

### Decision 5: No Automatic Retries
**Chosen**: Worker failure → Failure artefact → manual intervention
**Rationale**:
- Deterministic behavior
- Clear audit trail
- Retries add complexity (future enhancement)

**Trade-off**: Manual recovery vs. auto-recovery complexity

## Performance Characteristics

**Resource Usage**:
- Controller: 1 persistent container per role (~50MB)
- Workers: Ephemeral, scale to zero when idle
- Orchestrator: ~100 bytes per active worker (tracking state)
- Docker API: 4 calls per worker lifecycle

**Scalability**:
- Workers per role: Limited by `max_concurrent` (configurable)
- Worker startup: ~500ms (Docker overhead)
- Grant decision: <10ms to check limit (O(1) lookup)
- No performance regression on M3.3 workflows

**Measured Performance**:
- Phase transitions: <100ms (unchanged from M3.3)
- Consensus bidding: <3s for 3 agents (unchanged)
- Worker launch: <1s from grant to running

---

## Known Limitations (By Design)

1. **No Persistent Grant Queue** (M3.5)
   - Claims pause in pending_consensus when at max_concurrent
   - No queue persistence across orchestrator restarts
   - Acceptable for M3.4 scope

2. **No Automatic Retries** (Future)
   - Worker failure requires manual intervention
   - Clear audit trail maintained

3. **In-Memory Worker Tracking** (M3.5)
   - Orchestrator restart loses worker state
   - Workers become orphaned (cleaned by `sett down`)

4. **No Worker-to-Worker Communication** (Future)
   - Workers are independent
   - Sufficient for current use cases

## Migration Guide

### For Existing Agents (No Changes Required)
Agents without `mode` field continue working unchanged. Full backward compatibility maintained.

### For New Controller-Worker Agents

**Step 1**: Add mode and worker configuration to sett.yml:
```yaml
agents:
  my-controller:
    role: "MyRole"
    mode: "controller"              # NEW: Designates as controller
    image: "my-agent:latest"
    bidding_strategy: "exclusive"

    worker:                          # NEW: Worker configuration
      image: "my-agent:latest"
      max_concurrent: 3
      command: ["/app/run.sh"]
      workspace:
        mode: rw
```

**Step 2**: Rebuild orchestrator image (includes Docker client):
```bash
make docker-orchestrator
```

**Step 3**: Restart instance:
```bash
sett down
sett up
```

**Step 4**: Verify controller and workers:
```bash
docker ps --filter "name=sett-*-controller"
# Monitor for workers launching when claims are granted
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Worker Not Launching
**Symptom**: Controller bids but no worker appears
**Causes**:
1. Docker socket not mounted
2. Worker image missing
3. At max_concurrent limit

**Debug**:
```bash
sett logs orchestrator | grep worker
docker images | grep <worker-image>
docker ps -a | grep worker
```

### Worker Stuck/Not Completing
**Symptom**: Worker running but claim not completing
**Causes**:
1. Tool script hanging
2. Redis connection issues

**Debug**:
```bash
docker logs sett-{instance}-{agent}-worker-{claim}
```

### Max Concurrent Limit Ignored
**Symptom**: More workers than max_concurrent
**Causes**:
1. Race condition (brief overshoot acceptable)
2. WorkerManager not initialized

**Verify**:
```bash
sett logs orchestrator | grep "worker_limit_reached"
```
