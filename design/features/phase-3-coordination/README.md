# **Phase 3: "Coordination" - Multi-Agent Workflow**

**Goal**: Review → Parallel → Exclusive phases working with multiple agent types.

## **Phase Success Criteria**

- Complex workflow with review feedback loop
- Multiple agents working in parallel
- Proper error handling and recovery
- Controller-worker pattern for scaling

## **Key Features for This Phase**

1. **Consensus Bidding Model**
   - Full consensus waiting for all agent bids
   - Bid collection and validation
   - Agent registry management
   - Deterministic workflow execution

2. **Phased Execution System**
   - Review phase with feedback detection
   - Parallel phase coordination
   - Exclusive phase execution
   - Phase transition logic

3. **Controller-Worker Pattern**
   - Scalable agent architecture (replicas > 1)
   - Bidder-only and execute-only modes
   - Ephemeral container management
   - Race condition elimination

## **Implementation Constraints**

- No human interaction yet (Phase 4 dependency)
- Focus on agent coordination and workflow phases
- Enhanced error handling and failure recovery
- Production-level reliability required

## **Testing Requirements**

- Multi-agent coordination testing
- Phase transition validation
- Failure scenario testing
- Controller-worker pattern verification
- Load testing with multiple agents

## **Dependencies**

- **Phase 1**: Functional blackboard and orchestrator
- **Phase 2**: Working single-agent execution
- Multiple agent types for testing

## **Deliverables**

- Full consensus bidding implementation
- Three-phase claim execution (review/parallel/exclusive)
- Controller-worker scaling pattern
- Comprehensive multi-agent workflows
