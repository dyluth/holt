# **Feature design: M2.6 - Real-time Workflow Monitoring (Watch Command)**

**Purpose**: Implement comprehensive real-time monitoring of Holt workflows via CLI
**Scope**: Complete watch command with event streaming and forage --watch integration
**Estimated tokens**: ~3,500 tokens
**Read when**: Implementing watch functionality, working on CLI monitoring features

Associated phase: **Single Agent**
Status: **Approved**

## **1. The 'why': goal and success criteria**

### **1.1. Goal statement**

Provide users with a seamless, real-time view of all workflow activity through a single command that streams artefact creations, claim events, agent bids, and grant decisions as they occur.

### **1.2. User story**

As a Holt user, I want to run `holt forage --watch --goal "my task"` and immediately see the complete lifecycle of my workflow‚Äîfrom goal creation through agent bidding to final execution‚Äîin a continuous stream without needing to run additional commands. This allows me to monitor progress, debug issues, and understand system behavior in real-time.

### **1.3. Success criteria**

* A user can run `holt watch` (with auto-inferred instance) or `holt watch --name instance-name` and see a continuous stream of all workflow events (artefact creations, claims, bids, grants) until they press Ctrl+C.
* A user can run `holt forage --watch --goal "task"` and after the initial claim is created, the command automatically transitions into full watch mode, streaming all subsequent activity without exiting.
* A user can run `holt watch --output=json` and receive line-delimited JSON events suitable for parsing by external tools or scripts.
* When Redis connection is lost, the watch command displays a warning, attempts reconnection for up to 60 seconds, and gracefully exits if unsuccessful.

### **1.4. Non-goals**

* Event filtering (--filter flag) - reserved for future enhancement
* Historical event replay - watch only shows events from the moment of subscription
* Event persistence or logging to files - users can redirect stdout if needed
* Real-time performance metrics or dashboards - this is purely event streaming

## **2. The 'what': component impact analysis**

### **2.1. Blackboard changes**

**New/modified data structures:**
* No changes to existing Artefact, Claim, or Bid schemas

**New Pub/Sub channels:**
* `holt:{instance}:workflow_events` - New channel for bid and grant events
  * Carries JSON payloads with structure: `{"event": "bid_submitted"|"claim_granted", "data": {...}}`

**New methods:**
* `WorkflowEventsChannel(instanceName string) string` - Helper to construct channel name
* `SubscribeWorkflowEvents(ctx) (*WorkflowSubscription, error)` - Subscribe to workflow events
* Modify `SetBid()` to publish `bid_submitted` events after successful bid storage
* Add `PublishWorkflowEvent(ctx, eventType, data)` - Internal helper for publishing workflow events

**Event payload formats:**
```json
// bid_submitted
{"event":"bid_submitted","data":{"claim_id":"...","agent_name":"...","bid_type":"exclusive"}}

// claim_granted
{"event":"claim_granted","data":{"claim_id":"...","agent_name":"...","grant_type":"exclusive"}}
```

### **2.2. Orchestrator changes**

**New/modified logic:**
* In `grantClaim()` function: After successfully calling `UpdateClaim()`, publish a `claim_granted` event to `workflow_events` channel
* Event includes claim ID, winning agent name, and grant type (detect from which field is populated: GrantedExclusiveAgent ‚Üí "exclusive", GrantedReviewAgents ‚Üí "review", GrantedParallelAgents ‚Üí "parallel")
* Publishing errors are logged but do not fail the grant operation (best-effort delivery)

**New/modified configurations (holt.yml):**
* No changes

### **2.3. Agent pup changes**

**New/modified logic:**
* No changes - bid publishing happens in blackboard client

**Changes to the tool execution contract (stdin/stdout):**
* No changes

### **2.4. CLI changes**

**New/modified commands:**

1. **`holt watch` - Complete rewrite from stub**
   * Flags:
     * `--name, -n` (string, optional): Target instance name (auto-inferred from workspace if omitted)
     * `--output, -o` (string, default="default"): Output format ("default" or "json")
   * Behavior:
     * Infers instance using `instance.InferInstanceFromWorkspace()` if --name not provided
     * Connects to blackboard and subscribes to three channels: artefact_events, claim_events, workflow_events
     * Streams events to stdout in selected format until Ctrl+C or fatal error
     * Handles reconnection on transient Redis failures

2. **`holt forage` - Enhanced --watch behavior**
   * Modified behavior when `--watch` flag is true:
     * After successfully detecting claim creation, print: `‚úì Claim created. Watching for activity...`
     * Remove outdated "Phase 2+" messages
     * Call same streaming logic as `holt watch` command
     * Do not exit - continue streaming until user interrupts

**Changes to user output:**

Default format (human-readable):
```
[10:23:45] ‚ú® Artefact created: type=GoalDefined, id=abc-123
[10:23:45] ‚è≥ Claim created: claim=xyz-789, artefact=abc-123, status=pending_review
[10:23:46] üôã Bid submitted: agent=git-agent, claim=xyz-789, type=exclusive
[10:23:47] üèÜ Claim granted: agent=git-agent, claim=xyz-789, type=exclusive
[10:23:50] ‚ú® Artefact created: type=CodeCommit, id=def-456
```

JSON format (--output=json):
```json
{"timestamp":"2024-10-13T10:23:45Z","event":"artefact_created","data":{...artefact...}}
{"timestamp":"2024-10-13T10:23:45Z","event":"claim_created","data":{...claim...}}
{"timestamp":"2024-10-13T10:23:46Z","event":"bid_submitted","data":{"claim_id":"...","agent_name":"...","bid_type":"..."}}
{"timestamp":"2024-10-13T10:23:47Z","event":"claim_granted","data":{"claim_id":"...","agent_name":"...","grant_type":"..."}}
```

## **3. The 'how': implementation & testing plan**

### **3.1. Key design decisions & risks**

**Key Decisions:**

1. **Event-at-source publishing**: Bids are published from `SetBid()` in the blackboard client (not orchestrator polling loop) to ensure real-time visibility with zero delay. This is architecturally cleaner as the component causing state change announces it.

2. **Best-effort delivery**: Publishing errors during bid/grant events are logged but don't fail the primary operation. Redis Pub/Sub provides at-most-once delivery semantics - this is acceptable for monitoring/observability use case.

3. **Three-channel design**: Rather than multiplexing all events into one channel, we maintain separate channels for artefacts, claims, and workflow events. This preserves backward compatibility and allows future selective subscriptions.

4. **Normalized JSON structure**: JSON output uses `{"timestamp":"...", "event":"...", "data":{...}}` format rather than raw object dumps, making it easier to parse and process programmatically.

**Risks:**

* **Redis Pub/Sub delivery guarantees**: If a subscriber is slow or disconnected, events may be missed. This is inherent to Pub/Sub and acceptable for watch use case (users can check persistent blackboard state if needed).
* **Event ordering across channels**: Events from different channels may appear out-of-order due to Redis multiplexing. This is mitigated by adding timestamps on receipt.
* **Orchestrator backward compatibility**: Older orchestrators won't publish grant events. Watch will work but show incomplete view. Mitigated by requiring matched component versions.

### **3.2. Implementation steps**

**Phase 1: Blackboard event publishing (pkg/blackboard/)**
1. Add `WorkflowEventsChannel()` helper function
2. Add `PublishWorkflowEvent()` internal method
3. Modify `SetBid()` to publish `bid_submitted` event after successful write
4. Add `SubscribeWorkflowEvents()` method with WorkflowSubscription type
5. Add tests for new publish/subscribe functionality

**Phase 2: Orchestrator event publishing (internal/orchestrator/)**
1. In `grantClaim()`, after `UpdateClaim()` succeeds, call blackboard client to publish `claim_granted` event
2. Detect grant type from claim fields (GrantedExclusiveAgent/Review/Parallel)
3. Add logging for publish failures (non-fatal)
4. Add unit tests for event publishing logic

**Phase 3: Watch streaming logic (internal/watch/)**
1. Create `StreamActivity(ctx, bbClient, instanceName, outputFormat)` function
2. Subscribe to all three channels: artefact_events, claim_events, workflow_events
3. Use select statement to multiplex event streams
4. Implement default formatter (human-readable with emojis/timestamps)
5. Implement JSON formatter (line-delimited with normalized structure)
6. Implement reconnection logic (2s retry interval, 60s timeout)
7. Handle context cancellation for graceful Ctrl+C shutdown
8. Add comprehensive tests for formatters and error handling

**Phase 4: Watch command implementation (cmd/holt/commands/)**
1. Replace `runWatch()` stub with full implementation
2. Add `--output` flag with validation (default/json)
3. Use `instance.InferInstanceFromWorkspace()` when --name omitted
4. Connect to blackboard and call `watch.StreamActivity()`
5. Handle errors and provide clear user feedback

**Phase 5: Forage --watch integration (cmd/holt/commands/)**
1. After claim detection in forage --watch block, remove old messages
2. Print: `‚úì Claim created. Watching for activity...`
3. Call `watch.StreamActivity()` with same instance and blackboard client
4. Ensure proper error handling and cleanup

**Phase 6: Testing and validation**
1. Add unit tests for all new functions
2. Add integration tests for event publishing and consumption
3. Add E2E test: `holt forage --watch` full workflow validation
4. Add E2E test: `holt watch --output=json` parsing validation
5. Add E2E test: Reconnection behavior validation
6. Update Makefile test targets if needed

### **3.3. Performance & resource considerations**

**Resource usage:**
* Minimal CPU: Event streaming is I/O-bound, dominated by Redis Pub/Sub blocking reads
* Memory: ~2-5 MB for three subscriptions with buffered channels (30 events total buffered)
* Network: Low bandwidth (<10 KB/s typical), burst to ~100 KB/s during high activity
* Redis: Three persistent connections per watch session, negligible impact on Redis performance

**Scalability limits:**
* **Concurrent watchers**: Redis Pub/Sub scales to thousands of subscribers per channel without degradation
* **Event throughput**: Can handle 1000+ events/second without dropping messages (bounded by terminal output speed, not Redis)
* **Long-running sessions**: Watch can run indefinitely; no memory leaks expected (Go stdlib channels and Redis client handle cleanup)

**Performance requirements:**
* Event latency: <100ms from event occurrence to display (Redis Pub/Sub typically <10ms)
* Reconnection time: Must detect disconnect within 5s and reconnect within 2s on transient failures
* Startup time: Watch must connect and start streaming within 1s of command invocation

### **3.4. Testing strategy**

**Unit tests:**
* `pkg/blackboard/client_test.go`: Test `SetBid()` publishes bid_submitted event correctly
* `pkg/blackboard/client_test.go`: Test `SubscribeWorkflowEvents()` receives published events
* `internal/orchestrator/engine_test.go`: Test `grantClaim()` publishes claim_granted event
* `internal/watch/watch_test.go`: Test event formatting (default and JSON output)
* `internal/watch/watch_test.go`: Test reconnection logic with mock Redis failures
* `internal/watch/watch_test.go`: Test context cancellation and cleanup

**Integration tests:**
* Test complete flow: SetBid ‚Üí publish ‚Üí SubscribeWorkflowEvents ‚Üí receive
* Test orchestrator grant ‚Üí publish ‚Üí watch receives event
* Test watch command connects and receives events from all three channels
* Test forage --watch transitions smoothly from claim detection to streaming

**Performance tests:**
* Measure event latency (publish to receive time) under various loads
* Verify no memory leaks during 10-minute watch session with 1000 events
* Verify reconnection completes within 2s timeout under simulated network issues

**E2E tests (holt tests):**
1. **Full workflow watch test**:
   ```bash
   holt forage --watch --goal "test-file.txt" &
   # Assert: Claim created message appears within 5s
   # Assert: Bid submitted event appears within 2s
   # Assert: Claim granted event appears within 2s
   # Assert: CodeCommit artefact event appears within 10s
   ```

2. **JSON output parsing test**:
   ```bash
   holt watch --output=json > events.json &
   holt forage --goal "test.txt"
   sleep 5
   # Assert: events.json contains valid JSON lines
   # Assert: All event types present (artefact_created, claim_created, bid_submitted, claim_granted)
   ```

3. **Instance inference test**:
   ```bash
   holt up
   holt watch  # No --name flag
   # Assert: Watch auto-detects instance and starts streaming
   ```

## **4. Principle compliance check**

### **4.1. YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It)**

**New dependencies**: None. All functionality uses existing libraries:
* Redis Pub/Sub: Already used for artefact_events and claim_events
* JSON marshaling: Standard library encoding/json
* Time formatting: Standard library time package
* Context management: Standard library context package

### **4.2. Auditability**

**New artefacts**: None. This feature enhances *visibility* of existing artefacts but does not create new ones.

**Event publishing**: Bid and grant events are ephemeral monitoring signals. The authoritative state remains in Redis hashes (bids) and claims (grants). This is acceptable as:
* Bids are stored in `holt:{instance}:claim:{id}:bids` hash (persistent, queryable)
* Grants are stored in Claim.GrantedExclusiveAgent field (persistent, queryable)
* Events are for real-time monitoring only; source-of-truth is unchanged

### **4.3. Small, single-purpose components**

**Component responsibilities preserved:**
* **Blackboard**: Remains the eventing and storage layer (adds workflow_events channel)
* **Orchestrator**: Retains consensus and grant logic (adds event publishing as side-effect)
* **Pup**: Unchanged (bids remain blackboard operation)
* **CLI (watch package)**: New focused responsibility - event streaming and formatting

**No tight coupling introduced**: Watch package depends only on blackboard client interface. Components remain independently deployable.

### **4.4. Security considerations**

**Attack surface analysis:**
* **No new attack vectors**: Watch is read-only (subscribe-only) operation
* **No credential handling**: Uses existing Redis connection configuration
* **No sensitive data exposure**: Events contain only IDs, names, and types already visible in blackboard queries

**Container isolation:**
* Unchanged - watch runs in CLI context, not in orchestrator/agent containers

**Network communications:**
* Uses existing Redis Pub/Sub channels over existing connection
* No new ports, protocols, or external connections

### **4.5. Backward compatibility**

**API changes:**
* **Additive only**: New `workflow_events` channel and `SubscribeWorkflowEvents()` method
* **Existing APIs unchanged**: SetBid() signature unchanged (publishes event as side-effect)
* **Existing workflows preserved**: Old clients can ignore workflow_events channel

**Migration requirements:**
* None - feature is fully additive
* Older orchestrators won't publish grant events (watch will show incomplete view, but won't break)

**Deprecation path:**
* N/A - no breaking changes

### **4.6. Dependency impact**

**Redis usage:**
* **New channel**: `workflow_events` - one additional Pub/Sub channel per instance
* **Connection impact**: Watch command opens 3 subscriptions (vs 1 previously for forage --watch)
* **Memory impact**: Negligible - Redis Pub/Sub memory overhead is ~1KB per subscriber
* **Pattern changes**: None - still using same Redis Pub/Sub primitives

**Docker/container requirements:**
* No changes

**Go version:**
* No changes - uses only existing stdlib features

**Build dependencies:**
* No changes

**CI/CD impact:**
* Tests require Redis container (already present in integration test suite)

## **6. Error scenarios & edge cases**

### **6.1. Failure modes**

**Redis unavailable during watch startup:**
* Behavior: Command fails immediately with clear error message
* Error: `‚úó Cannot connect to Redis at redis://host:port`
* Exit code: 1
* Guidance: "Check that instance is running: holt list"

**Redis connection lost during streaming:**
* Behavior: Display warning, attempt reconnection
* Warning: `‚ö†Ô∏è  Connection to blackboard lost. Reconnecting...`
* Retry: Every 2 seconds for up to 60 seconds
* Success: Resume streaming with message `‚úì Reconnected to blackboard`
* Failure: Exit with error after 60s timeout
* Exit code: 1

**Malformed event JSON in subscriptions:**
* Behavior: Log error to stderr, skip event, continue streaming
* Error format: `‚ö†Ô∏è  Failed to parse event: <error details>`
* Impact: Single event lost, stream continues

**Instance does not exist (for watch command):**
* Behavior: Fail fast with helpful error
* Error: `‚úó Instance 'name' not found. Run 'holt list' to see available instances.`
* Exit code: 1

**No instances found (when auto-inferring):**
* Behavior: Fail with setup guidance
* Error: `‚úó No Holt instances found for this workspace. Run 'holt up' to start an instance.`
* Exit code: 1

**Multiple instances found (when auto-inferring):**
* Behavior: Fail with disambiguation guidance
* Error: `‚úó Multiple instances found. Use --name to specify: holt watch --name <instance>`
* Exit code: 1

### **6.2. Concurrency considerations**

**Multiple watch sessions on same instance:**
* Safe: Each watch creates independent subscriptions to Redis Pub/Sub
* No shared state between watch processes
* Each receives all events independently

**Watch + agent execution simultaneously:**
* Safe: Watch is read-only subscriber
* Agent bid submission ‚Üí publish ‚Üí watch receives event (proper isolation)

**Orchestrator grant race with watch subscription:**
* Possible: Watch may miss grant event if it occurs between subscription setup and message receipt
* Acceptable: This is inherent to "watch from now" semantics (not historical replay)
* Mitigation: User can query current claim state with `holt hoard` if needed

**Forage --watch process termination:**
* Cleanup: Context cancellation triggers subscription Close() methods
* No leak: Redis client properly unsubscribes on context cancellation
* Signal handling: SIGINT (Ctrl+C) cancels context, triggers clean shutdown

### **6.3. Edge case handling**

**Empty events (no activity during watch):**
* Behavior: Watch displays nothing (not an error)
* User sees only their command prompt after initial connection
* Ctrl+C still works for exit

**Very high event volume (>1000 events/second):**
* Behavior: Terminal output becomes bottleneck (watch processes faster than display)
* Buffering: Channels buffer up to 10 events per channel (30 total)
* Outcome: Some events may be dropped by Redis Pub/Sub (at-most-once delivery)
* Mitigation: Use --output=json | tee file.json for capturing high-volume streams

**Long-running watch (hours/days):**
* Memory: Stable (no leaks expected from Go stdlib channels and Redis client)
* Connection: Redis keepalive maintains connection
* Testing: Validate 1-hour continuous watch session shows stable memory (<10MB)

**Network partition between CLI and Redis:**
* Behavior: Treated same as connection lost (see section 6.1)
* Reconnection attempts for 60s, then exit

**Watch during instance shutdown:**
* Behavior: Redis connections close, triggers reconnection logic
* Outcome: After 60s timeout, watch exits with error
* Expected: User should be aware instance is shutting down

## **7. Open questions & decisions**

All questions resolved during design phase:
* ‚úÖ Where to publish bid events: SetBid() in blackboard client (event-at-source)
* ‚úÖ JSON format: Normalized structure with event type and data fields
* ‚úÖ Instance inference: Use existing InferInstanceFromWorkspace() logic
* ‚úÖ Channel naming: `workflow_events` (singular, matching artefact_events pattern)
* ‚úÖ Reconnection strategy: Warn, retry 2s interval, 60s timeout

## **8. AI agent implementation guidance**

### **8.1. Development approach**

**Implementation order (critical):**
1. Start with blackboard event publishing - this unblocks everything else
2. Add orchestrator grant event publishing
3. Implement streaming logic in internal/watch package
4. Wire up watch command
5. Integrate with forage --watch
6. Add tests throughout (not at end)

**Defensive programming:**
* Always check context.Done() in select statements
* Validate all JSON marshal/unmarshal operations
* Handle nil pointers from subscription channels during shutdown
* Use defer for cleanup (subscription.Close(), client.Close())

### **8.2. Common pitfalls to avoid**

**Critical mistakes to watch for:**
* ‚ùå Forgetting to publish events in error paths (publish AFTER successful operation only)
* ‚ùå Blocking on channel sends during shutdown (use select with ctx.Done())
* ‚ùå Not closing subscriptions on function exit (use defer)
* ‚ùå Assuming events arrive in order across channels (they don't - add timestamps)
* ‚ùå Returning errors that should be warnings (distinguish fatal vs non-fatal failures)
* ‚ùå Publishing before persisting state (publish AFTER Redis write succeeds)

**Testing pitfalls:**
* ‚ùå Forgetting to wait for goroutines in tests (use sync.WaitGroup or channels)
* ‚ùå Not testing reconnection logic (use mock Redis failures)
* ‚ùå Assuming events appear instantly (add small time.Sleep or retry logic in tests)

### **8.3. Integration checklist**

Pre-implementation verification:
* [x] No breaking changes to existing SetBid() or UpdateClaim() signatures
* [x] New workflow_events channel does not conflict with existing channels
* [x] Event payload schemas are documented and validated
* [x] Existing forage --watch behavior preserved until integration point

## **9. Operational readiness**

### **9.1. Monitoring and observability**

**Metrics to track:**
* Count of active watch subscriptions per instance (observable via Redis CLIENT LIST)
* Event publish failures (logged to orchestrator stderr)
* Watch command connection failures (logged to CLI stderr)

**Structured logging events:**
* Orchestrator: `[INFO] Published claim_granted event: claim_id=<id>`
* Orchestrator: `[WARN] Failed to publish claim_granted event: <error>`
* Watch: `‚ö†Ô∏è  Connection to blackboard lost. Reconnecting...`
* Watch: `‚úì Reconnected to blackboard`

**Health check modifications:**
* None required - watch is a CLI tool, not a long-running service

**Operator diagnostics:**
* Check Redis Pub/Sub: `redis-cli PUBSUB CHANNELS holt:*:workflow_events`
* Check active subscribers: `redis-cli PUBSUB NUMSUB holt:<instance>:workflow_events`
* Verify event publishing: `redis-cli SUBSCRIBE holt:<instance>:workflow_events` (manual monitoring)

### **9.2. Rollback and disaster recovery**

**Feature disable:**
* Cannot disable individual channels - this is a full feature (not a flag)
* Rollback: Deploy previous CLI version (watch will work without grant events, just incomplete)

**Rollback procedure:**
1. If grant events cause issues, rollback orchestrator only (watch still works for artefacts/claims/bids)
2. If bid events cause issues, rollback blackboard client and orchestrator (watch shows artefacts/claims only)
3. If watch command has issues, users can continue using `holt hoard` for state inspection

**Data migration:**
* None required - feature is read-only

**Rollback time:**
* Immediate - redeploy containers with previous image versions

### **9.3. Documentation and training**

**CLI command documentation:**
* Update `holt watch --help` with full command description and examples
* Update `holt forage --help` to clarify --watch behavior
* Add `holt watch` examples to README or user guide

**Example documentation to add:**
```bash
# Watch all activity on inferred instance
holt watch

# Watch specific instance
holt watch --name prod-instance

# Export events as JSON for analysis
holt watch --output=json > workflow-events.jsonl

# Submit goal and watch full workflow
holt forage --watch --goal "Add user authentication"
```

**Troubleshooting guide additions:**
* "Watch command shows 'Connection lost' repeatedly" ‚Üí Check Redis container status
* "Watch shows artefacts but not bids/grants" ‚Üí Ensure orchestrator version matches CLI version
* "Forage --watch exits after claim created" ‚Üí Update CLI to latest version

**Team training:**
* No special training required - feature is user-facing CLI improvement

## **10. Self-validation checklist**
