# **Phase 2: "Single Agent" - Basic Execution**

**Goal**: One agent can claim and execute work with full Git integration.

## **Phase Success Criteria**

- End-to-end workflow: forage → claim → execute → artifact
- Agent can modify code and commit results
- Full audit trail on blackboard
- Git workspace integration functional

## **Key Features for This Phase**

1. **Agent Cub Implementation**
   - Claim watching and bidding logic
   - Context assembly algorithm
   - Tool execution contract
   - Concurrent goroutine architecture

2. **Git Workspace Integration**
   - Clean repository requirements
   - Workspace mounting for containers
   - Commit workflow and artifact creation
   - Git state management

3. **Basic Claim Execution**
   - Single agent bidding and execution
   - Artifact creation and posting
   - Error handling and failure artifacts
   - Container lifecycle management

## **Implementation Constraints**

- Single agent only (no multi-agent coordination)
- No review or parallel phases (Phase 3 dependency)
- Basic error handling (enhanced in Phase 3)
- No human interaction (Phase 4 dependency)

## **Testing Requirements**

- Agent cub unit and integration tests
- Git workflow end-to-end testing
- Container execution testing
- Blackboard state verification

## **Dependencies**

- **Phase 1**: Requires functional blackboard and orchestrator
- Clean Git repository and Docker environment

## **Deliverables**

- Functional agent cub binary
- Working agent container execution
- Git integration with commit workflow
- Single-agent end-to-end workflow
