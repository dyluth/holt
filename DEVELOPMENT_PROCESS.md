# **Holt Development Process: Feature Lifecycle & AI Collaboration**

**Purpose**: Detailed process documentation for systematic feature development  
**Scope**: Reference - read when designing or implementing features  
**Estimated tokens**: ~2,000 tokens  
**Read when**: Starting feature design, implementing features, or reviewing process

## **Feature Development Lifecycle**

Holt follows a systematic **three-stage feature development process** designed for iterative collaboration between humans and AI agents. This process ensures quality, consistency, and architectural alignment across all feature development.

### **Stage 1: Feature Design (Human-AI Collaboration)**

**Purpose**: Create a comprehensive, unambiguous feature specification

**Process**:
1. **Initiate Design**: Start with `design/holt-feature-design-template.md` as the foundation
2. **Iterative Refinement**: 
   - Human provides initial requirements and context
   - AI agent fills out template sections systematically
   - Multiple rounds of discussion and clarification
   - Focus on completeness, clarity, and architectural consistency
3. **Cross-Component Analysis**: Validate impact on all system components (Orchestrator, Pup, CLI, Blackboard)
4. **Dependency Verification**: Ensure prerequisites from earlier phases are satisfied
5. **Design Approval**: Human review and final approval of completed design document

**Quality Gates**:
- All template sections completed with specific, actionable content
- Success criteria are measurable and testable
- Component impact analysis covers every system element
- No architectural contradictions or violations
- Implementation plan is detailed and feasible

**Deliverable**: Approved feature design document stored in `design/features/phase-X/feature-name.md`

### **Stage 2: Implementation (AI Agent Execution)**

**Purpose**: Systematically implement the approved feature design

**Process**:
1. **Implementation Handoff**: AI agent receives approved design document
2. **Systematic Development**: 
   - Follow implementation steps from design document section 3.2
   - Implement tests before or alongside code (TDD approach)
   - Validate against success criteria from section 1.3 continuously
   - Handle error scenarios identified in section 6
3. **Quality Assurance**:
   - Run all tests defined in section 3.4
   - Verify performance requirements from section 3.3
   - Complete all Definition of Done items from section 5
4. **Integration Testing**: Ensure feature works with existing system components

**Quality Gates**:
- All implementation steps completed successfully
- All tests passing (unit, integration, E2E)
- Performance requirements met and verified
- Error handling implemented and tested
- Definition of Done checklist 100% complete

**Deliverable**: Fully implemented feature with passing tests and documentation

### **Stage 3: Integration & Validation (Human-AI Verification)**

**Purpose**: Validate feature integration and prepare for delivery

**Process**:
1. **Code Review**: Human review of implementation against design
2. **System Integration**: Full system testing with the new feature
3. **Documentation Update**: Update system documentation if needed
4. **Phase Validation**: Confirm feature contributes to phase success criteria
5. **Handoff Preparation**: Prepare for integration with subsequent features

**Quality Gates**:
- Code quality meets project standards
- System tests pass with new feature integrated
- No regressions in existing functionality
- Phase success criteria remain achievable
- Documentation accurately reflects current state

**Deliverable**: Production-ready feature integrated into the main system

## **File Organization for Feature Designs**

Feature design documents are organized by delivery phase to maintain clear progression and dependency management:

```
design/features/
├── phase-1-heartbeat/              # Core Infrastructure
│   ├── redis-blackboard-foundation.md
│   ├── basic-orchestrator-engine.md
│   └── cli-lifecycle-commands.md
├── phase-2-single-agent/           # Basic Execution
│   ├── agent-pup-implementation.md
│   ├── git-workspace-integration.md
│   └── basic-claim-execution.md
├── phase-3-coordination/           # Multi-Agent Workflow
│   ├── consensus-bidding-model.md
│   ├── phased-execution-system.md
│   └── controller-worker-pattern.md
└── phase-4-human-loop/             # Production Ready
    ├── question-answer-system.md
    ├── monitoring-health-checks.md
    └── production-readiness.md
```

## **AI Agent Guidelines for Feature Development**

### **During Design Stage**
- Ask clarifying questions when requirements are ambiguous
- Propose concrete alternatives when trade-offs exist
- Always consider error cases and edge scenarios
- Validate design against existing system architecture
- Identify dependencies on other features or components

### **During Implementation Stage**
- Follow the approved design document exactly
- Implement comprehensive error handling from the start
- Write tests before or alongside implementation
- Validate assumptions with working code
- Report blockers or design issues immediately

### **During Integration Stage**
- Test thoroughly in clean environments
- Document any deviations from the original design
- Verify all quality gates are satisfied
- Communicate integration requirements clearly

## **Quality Standards**

Every feature design must:
- Complete all sections of the template with specific, actionable content
- Define measurable success criteria and comprehensive testing strategy
- Analyze impact on all system components (Orchestrator, Pup, CLI, Blackboard)
- Include error handling and edge case analysis
- Align with Holt's guiding principles and architectural consistency

## **Phase Dependencies**

Features must respect phase dependencies:
- Phase 2 features depend on Phase 1 completion
- Phase 3 features depend on Phase 2 completion  
- Phase 4 features depend on Phase 3 completion

Cross-phase dependencies should be explicitly documented in the design's section 2 (Component Impact Analysis).

This structured approach ensures every feature is well-designed, properly implemented, and seamlessly integrated while maintaining the high standards required for a production-ready system.
