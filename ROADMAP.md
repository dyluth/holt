# Holt Project Roadmap

**Purpose**: To provide a clear overview of the project's phased delivery plan, key objectives, and future direction. This document is the single source of truth for the Holt roadmap.

## The Phased Approach

Holt is being developed through a series of well-defined phases, each delivering a significant leap in capabilities. This approach ensures that the platform is built on a solid foundation, with each new feature set expanding upon a stable core.

### Phase 1: "Heartbeat" âœ…
*Goal: Prove the core blackboard architecture works with basic orchestrator and CLI functionality.*
- **Features:** Redis blackboard with Pub/Sub, CLI for instance management, basic orchestrator claim engine.

### Phase 2: "Single Agent" âœ…
*Goal: Enable a single agent to perform a complete, useful task.*
- **Features:** Agent `pup` implementation, claim bidding, Git workspace integration, and context assembly.

### Phase 3: "Coordination" âœ…
*Goal: Orchestrate multiple, specialized agents in a collaborative workflow.*
- **Features:** Multi-stage pipelines (review â†’ parallel â†’ exclusive), controller-worker scaling pattern, consensus bidding, automated feedback loops, and powerful CLI observability features.

### Phase 4: "Human-in-the-Loop" ðŸš§
*Goal: Make the system production-ready with human oversight.*
- **Features:** `Question`/`Answer` artefacts for human guidance and mandatory approval gates for critical actions.

### Phase 5: "Complex Coordination" ðŸ“‹
*Goal: Enable the orchestration of complex, non-linear workflows (DAGs).*
- **Features:** Support for "fan-in" synchronization patterns and conditional workflow pathing based on agent bidding logic.

### Phase 6: "Kubernetes-Native" ðŸ“‹
*Goal: Evolve Holt into a first-class, native Kubernetes platform.*
- **Features:** A **Holt Operator** for managing instances via Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs), native integration with Kubernetes networking and storage, and **Prometheus metrics endpoints**.
